# ProjectTecBlog
Another project of the Udemy Course I'm taking, where I created a website using HTML and CSS.

As I advance in my studies, I realize that my biggest "happy accident" is not closing a tag, wich leads to the formatation of the main tag runs trough all the document, even where I don't want it to be.
This project was very challenging and I'm looking forward to learn even more about web development.
Big thanks to the teacher of the course, Jamilton Damasceno (https://github.com/jamiltondamasceno)
